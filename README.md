Omnifood is an strong UX-UI project learned from [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/), based on an subscription for food delivery. In this project I learned more about CSS, framework [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) and more.
